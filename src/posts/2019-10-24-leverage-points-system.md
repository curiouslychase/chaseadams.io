I've been sharing an article recently called [Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System](leverage-points) by Donella Meadows.

The specific thing I've been sharing, is the list of places to intervene in a system:

> PLACES TO INTERVENE IN A SYSTEM
> (in increasing order of effectiveness)
>
> 12. Constants, parameters, numbers (such as subsidies, taxes, standards).
> 11. The sizes of buffers and other stabilizing stocks, relative to their flows.
> 10. The structure of material stocks and flows (such as transport networks, population age structures).
> 9. The lengths of delays, relative to the rate of system change.
> 8. The strength of negative feedback loops, relative to the impacts they are trying to correct against.
> 7. The gain around driving positive feedback loops.
> 6. The structure of information flows (who does and does not have access to information).
> 5. The rules of the system (such as incentives, punishments, constraints).
> 4. The power to add, change, evolve, or self-organize system structure.
> 3. The goals of the system.
> 2. The mindset or paradigm out of which the system — its goals, structure, rules, delays, parameters — arises.
> 1. The power to transcend paradigms.

I often find that when I'm stressed or don't have "good answers" for a system or something in it, I fall back on the less effective places to intervene (12-7).

The important places that I can intervene that I want to start trying to intervene ar 6-1.
