#+TITLE: My Favorite Podcasts

#+DESCRIPTION: Podcasts that I listen to and recommend others listen to
#+DRAFT: true

This list is a great, big round-up of all my favorite podcasts and a few "gateway" episodes.

* Essentials

These are the podcasts that I listen to at least once a week (some I listen to a few days a week) that I couldn't get through dog walks or car rides without!

** GoTimeFM

/A weekly panelist podcast discussing the Go programming language, the community, and everything in between./

If you're even /remotely/ interested in golang, this is the podcast for you. Every week they have guests from the community who use go on a daily basis building software that runs the web.

Beyond that, GoTimeFM holds a special place in my heart: it got me through a lot of days pushing my newborn baby girl in her stroller. It will forever be a part of the bond that I have with her.

** The Minimalists Podcast

/Joshua Fields Millburn & Ryan Nicodemus discuss living a meaningful life with less./

I don't actually agree that living a life with less is the answer (or the path), but The Minimalists podcast was what got me started on my journey of asking the question: *What does it mean to have "enough"?*

** College Info Geek Podcast

/a show dedicated to helping students learn and improve in all areas of life./

I know...I'm not in "school" anymore, but I'm a life-long learner & the information that Thomas Frank shares on this podcast is solid. He talks about how to be successful in college, but he also talks about self-awareness, creating content for the web and interviews authors about books I've either read or want to read that acts as great bonus content.

These three topics are a big ole ball of yarn, even though they're seemingly different, I've found that they're all separate circles of a venn diagram.

* Interesting People & Random Stuff

Sometimes I like to just listen to podcasts that have nothing to do with anything that immediately touches my edge nodes of life. I like listening to other people talk about aspects of life that I'm unfamiliar with, that I'd like to know more about or that I think just sounds interesting and that's as far as it goes.
