Want to enable infinite scrollback in iTerm2? By default, iTerm2 has a scrollback buffer of 1000 lines. Since most of my day is doing builds and running watch tasks with lots of output, I want to have infinite scrollback.

1. In iTerm2, open **Settings**
2. Click on **Profiles**
3. Cick on **Terminal**
4. Under the **Scrollback Buffer** Heading, click the checkbox for **Unlimited scrollback**
