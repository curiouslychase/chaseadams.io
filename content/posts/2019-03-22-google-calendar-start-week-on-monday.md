I consider Monday the start of my week, so I like to make sure my Calendars are setup properly.

## Google Calendar

- Open you Google Calendar in your browser
- Click the **Gear** in the top bar
- Click settings
- Scroll to **"View options"**
- In **Start week on** dropdown menu, change "Sunday" to "Monday"

## Apple Calendar (Mac)

- Open the Calendar app on your Mac
- Click **Calendar** in the menu bar
- Click **Preferences**
- In **General**, find **Start week on:** and change it from "Sunday" to "Monday"
