If you use a Mac, it's likely that you've installed a lot of apps, utilities, executables and fonts. Overtime you start to build up the toolset that helps you to be most effective.

But what happens when you have to get a new Mac? What about when you have multiple Macs and you want to keep your toolset in sync?

This is where Homebrew, a package manager for MacOS, comes to the rescue. It makes it easy to find and install everything you use on your Mac, from apps installed from the internet, apps that are only from the Mac App Store, tools you use in the command line, languages, fonts...the list goes on!

## Who Should Read This

Wondering if this is worth your time? If you answer **yes** to any of the following questions, then you're in the right place!

- Are you a Mac power user or want to become one?
- Are you a developer/programmer who has to install dependencies for your workflow? (including your editor, terminal, fonts, languages or executables)
- Are you a power user or a developer who wants to have a list of the things that should exist on your machine?
- Do you want to be able to install all of your tools by running a single command instead of having to remember how to install each one?

If you answered **yes** to any or all of those questions, then let's get started with how to use Homebrew!

## What You Need To Get Started

You should be familiar with how to open the Terminal application on your Mac. If you're not, it's simple to learn and a worthwhile investment!

## Install Homebrew

To install Homebrew, visit [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/) and you'll see a line of text that starts with `/usr/bin/ruby`. **Don't install it yet!**

### Tip

Whenever you see a command where someone has said **Paste this into your terminal** it's *always* a good idea to look at what you're pasting.

The command that Homebrew is having you run is a type of "curlexec" command.

**curl** is a utility that ships with Mac's that makes a request to a URL on your behalf (just like the browser, but without the user interface).
